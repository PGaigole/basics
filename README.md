# My Simple HTML and CSS Project

Welcome to my simple HTML and CSS project! This repository contains a basic HTML file and a CSS file that you can download and open on your computer to see how they work together.

## What’s Included

- `index.html` - The main HTML file that structures the content of the webpage.
- `styles.css` - The CSS file that styles the content of the webpage.

## How to Use

Follow these steps to use the files in this repository:

1. **Download the Files:**
   - Click the "Code" button on the top right of the repository page.
   - Select "Download ZIP" from the dropdown menu.
   - Extract the ZIP file to a location on your computer.

2. **Open the HTML File:**
   - Locate the `html` file in the extracted folder.
   - Double-click on `html` to open it in your default web browser (e.g., Chrome, Firefox, Safari).

3. **View the Page:**
   - The HTML file will be displayed in your browser with styles applied from the `css` file.
   - You should see a simple webpage that demonstrates basic HTML and CSS styling.

## Customizing

If you want to make changes to the webpage, you can:

1. **Edit the HTML File:**
   - Open `html` in a text editor (e.g., Notepad, VSCode).
   - Modify the HTML code as needed and save the file.

2. **Edit the CSS File:**
   - Open `css` in a text editor.
   - Change the CSS styles and save the file.
   - Refresh the `html` page in your browser to see the updates.

## Troubleshooting

- **File Not Displaying Correctly:**
  - Ensure that both `html` and `css` are in the same folder.
  - Make sure you are opening the `html` file in your web browser.

- **Can't See Changes:**
  - If you make changes to the files but don’t see them immediately, try refreshing your browser (usually by pressing `F5` or `Ctrl+R`).
